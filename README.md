# CNN-from-scratch


# Deep Convolutional Neural Network From Scratch

This is an image recognition program for MNIST dataset written in C++ from scratch.

As OPenACC and CUDA are applied to the code, it can run on GPUs.

OPenACC is a directive based GPU programming support framework.

 
# Features

This program supports Tensor Core. (the code is in dot.cu)

Tensor Core is an arithmetic circuit specialized for matrix multiplication operations.
